# RYM to MP3 (beta)

This tool uses [rateyourmusic.com](https://rateyourmusic.com/) and its included YouTube and SoundCloud media links to **download music with all the correct MP3 metadata**. RYM is a music database site with a vast amount of **unreleased music** that isn't on traditional streaming services, so this script is **optimized for uploading to Spotify as local files**. All of this can be done simply by **running one command with a RYM URL as an argument**, see below. This script works for **singles, mixtapes, EPs, albums, etc.** As long as it has a YouTube or SoundCloud media link.

SoundCloud is preferred as tracks are already cropped into individual tracks, and YouTube uploads are usually uploaded as one full 40-some-minute long video for the entire album.
However, if SoundCloud is not an option, this script will take the track lengths from RYM and crop a full YouTube video into individual sections representing tracks.
